# Pronunciation Translation System

**üöß Work in Progress üöß**

This project builds a cross-linguistic pronunciation translation system that converts words from one language to phonetic spellings that approximate the pronunciation using another language's orthographic rules. The system uses the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) as an intermediate representation, employing machine learning models for grapheme-to-phoneme and phoneme-to-grapheme conversion. For example, it can translate German "Stra√üe" through IPA "Àà ÉtraÀês…ô" to a Spanish spelling approximation that helps Spanish speakers pronounce the German word correctly. The system is built using PyTorch/MLX for model training, Polars for data processing, Flask for the web interface, and is designed for deployment on Google Kubernetes Engine.

For detailed implementation plans and architecture overview, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Setup for Collaborators

This project uses Git submodules for dataset dependencies. After cloning the repository, run:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This will download the required datasets including the ipa-dict data in `data/ipa-dict/`.
