# Pronunciation Translator - Implementation Progress

Last updated: 2025-10-04

## Quick Status Overview

- **Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure & Data
- **Overall Progress:** ~20% complete
- **Next Steps:** Tokenizer infrastructure (1.3)

---

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Data

### ‚úÖ 1.1 Repository Setup
**Status:** Complete

- [x] Core directory structure created (`src/pronunciation_translator/`)
- [x] `pyproject.toml` configured
- [x] Data adapters package structure implemented
- [ ] Additional directories (models/, cli/, examples/, k8s/, docker/, flows/) - pending

**Files created:**
- `src/pronunciation_translator/__init__.py`
- `src/pronunciation_translator/data_adapters/`

---

### ‚úÖ 1.2 Data Source and Adapters
**Status:** Complete

- [x] Base data adapter interface (`BaseDataAdapter`)
- [x] IPA Dict adapter implementation (`IPADictAdapter`)
- [x] Polars integration for data loading
- [x] Comprehensive IPA character validation
- [x] Data validation and statistics methods
- [x] Multi-language file support

**Implementation details:**
- Primary dataset: ipa-dict (cloned to `data/ipa-dict/`)
- Adapter returns Polars DataFrames with columns: `word`, `ipa`, `language`
- Modified to select **last pronunciation** when multiple comma-separated alternatives exist
- Comprehensive IPA character set includes:
  - Vowels, consonants (pulmonic + additional)
  - Diacritics (syllabic, raised, lowered, aspirated, etc.)
  - Suprasegmental modifiers (velarized, palatalized, pharyngealized, etc.)
  - Prosodic marks (syllable breaks, intonation, linking)

**Files created:**
- `src/pronunciation_translator/data_adapters/base.py`
- `src/pronunciation_translator/data_adapters/ipa_dict_adapter.py`
- `src/pronunciation_translator/data_adapters/__init__.py`
- `test_adapter.py` (test script)
- `test_adapter_simple.py` (simple test without Polars)

**Key decisions made:**
- When multiple pronunciations are available (comma-separated), select the **last one** as it's typically the most standard/formal variant
- Validation warnings only for truly unusual characters not in comprehensive IPA set

### üöß 1.3 Tokenizer Infrastructure
**Status:** Not started

- [ ] Character-level tokenizer base class
- [ ] Per-language tokenizer generation
- [ ] Special tokens support (`<PAD>`, `<SOS>`, `<EOS>`, `<UNK>`)
- [ ] Tokenizer JSON format (`{lang}_spelling.json`, `{lang}_ipa.json`)
- [ ] Auto-generation from training data
- [ ] Tokenizer API integration

**Next steps:**
1. Design tokenizer base class
2. Implement vocabulary building from data adapter output
3. Add encoding/decoding methods
4. Test with German dataset

---

### ‚¨ú 1.4 Dataset Infrastructure
**Status:** Not started

- [ ] PyTorch Dataset classes
- [ ] DataLoader integration
- [ ] Dictionary lookup system (hash tables)
- [ ] Train/validation/test split utilities
- [ ] Data augmentation considerations

**Dependencies:** Requires 1.3 (Tokenizer Infrastructure) to be complete

## Technical Decisions Log

### 2025-10-04: Pronunciation Selection Strategy
**Decision:** When multiple comma-separated pronunciations exist, select the last one.

**Rationale:**
- In ipa-dict, multiple pronunciations often represent regional variants or alternative forms
- The last pronunciation tends to be more standard/formal
- Simplifies the dataset (one word ‚Üí one IPA mapping)
- Reduces model training complexity

**Impact:** `IPADictAdapter._parse_ipa_pronunciations()` returns `str` instead of `list[str]`

---

### 2025-10-04: Comprehensive IPA Character Set
**Decision:** Expanded IPA validation to include all standard IPA symbols with inline documentation.

**Rationale:**
- Original validation was flagging legitimate IPA characters as "unusual"
- Comprehensive set covers: diacritics, suprasegmental modifiers, prosodic marks
- Inline comments improve code readability and serve as IPA reference

**Impact:** Validation warnings now only appear for truly non-IPA characters

---

## Known Issues & Blockers

None currently.

---

## Notes & Ideas

- Consider adding support for alternative pronunciation strategies (first, random, all)
- May want to track which pronunciations were selected for analysis
- Future: phonetic feature-based IPA mapping (Phase 3 consideration)
